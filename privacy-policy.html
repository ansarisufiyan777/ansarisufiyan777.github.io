                <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I may employ third-party companies and
                    individuals due to the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                    <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I want to inform users of this Service
                    that these third parties have access to your Personal
                    Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                    them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                    disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I value your trust in providing us your
                    Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                    acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                    of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                    storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                    guarantee its absolute security.

                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                    me with personal information, I immediately
                    delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                    and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                    personal information, please contact me so that
                    I will be able to do necessary actions.
